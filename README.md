## 🔥 What is FlameIQ?

**FlameIQ** is an AI-augmented performance intelligence platform for Python developers and engineering teams.

It goes far beyond traditional profilers — FlameIQ helps you **profile, detect, debug, and prevent performance regressions** across local development, CI pipelines, and production workloads.

Whether you're investigating a slow script or optimizing a complex service, FlameIQ gives you:

- 🔍 **High-fidelity flamegraphs** for visual call stack inspection  
- 🤖 **AI-powered performance insights** to guide optimizations and detect anti-patterns  
- 📈 **Cloud-based dashboards** to track regressions across commits and releases (Pro)  
- ⚙️ **GitHub bot integrations** that block perf regressions in pull requests  
- 🧪 **Time-travel debugging** for comparing trace diffs over time  
- 🧰 **CLI-first developer experience**, no code changes or intrusive instrumentation required

FlameIQ is designed to grow with you — from solo profiling on your laptop to **team-wide performance observability** in the cloud.

**Built for speed. Powered by insight. Trusted in CI.**
